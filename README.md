Fun Checkers project I did, and an AI to play against you, originally put together here http://codepen.io/caleboleary/pen/qRgJLN.

The version in this repo looks 4 moves ahead as opposed to 3 that the codepen version does, since it's a bit quicker to run outside of codepen. It's naturally harder to beat as it can see farther ahead.

Repo set up using create-react-app
Play at codepen, download the build folder and open index.html, or download the whole project and 'npm start' to play.
